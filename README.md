# 🌏 AirPure Innovations – Market Fit Research for Air Purifier Development (AQI Analytics)

## 📌 Project Overview

**AirPure Innovations** is a startup addressing India’s air quality crisis — with 14 of the world’s top 20 most polluted cities located here.
This project focuses on **data-driven market fit research** for launching air purifiers, using **AQI, health, vehicle, and population datasets** to identify **priority markets, health risks, and demand triggers**.

## 📊 Primary Analysis Highlights

1. **Top 5 & Bottom 5 Cities by AQI (Dec 2024–May 2025)**

   * Worst: Byrnihat, Delhi, Hajipur, Bahadurgarh, Gurugram
   * Best: Tirunelveli, Palkalaiperur, Madikeri, Vijayapura, Chamarajanagar

2. **Southern States Pollutant Patterns**

   * PM10 & PM2.5 dominate in most states; gases like NO₂, SO₂, and NH₃ remain lower.

3. **Weekday vs Weekend AQI in Metro Cities**

   * Delhi shows improvement on weekends; other metros vary slightly.

4. **Worst Months for AQI**

   * November, December, and January show consistently high pollution.

5. **Health Impact**

   * Acute Diarrheal Disease & Dengue are among the most reported illnesses, with higher AQI states reporting more cases.

6. **EV Adoption vs AQI**

   * High EV adoption does not always mean better air quality (e.g., Delhi).

## 🔍 Secondary Analysis Insights

* **Age Impact:** Children and elderly are most vulnerable, with Delhi teens showing nearly double asthma rates compared to cleaner cities.
* **Competitors:** Dyson, Philips, Coway, Xiaomi lead; gaps exist in smart AQI syncing & compact designs.
* **Population vs AQI:** Larger cities generally have worse AQI, but some smaller industrial hubs are equally bad.
* **Awareness:** Public understanding of AQI’s health impact remains low.
* **Policies:** Odd-even schemes, BS6 norms, and GRAP show mixed success.
